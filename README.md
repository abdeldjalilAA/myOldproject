# 🏗️ My Old Projects – A Throwback to My Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **collection of old projects**! These are the projects I built while learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Some of them are simple experiments, while others were my way of solving problems and understanding concepts.  

## 📂 Project Categories  
🔹 **HTML & CSS:** My first steps in web development, exploring layouts, styling, and responsiveness.  
🔹 **JavaScript Experiments:** Small scripts, DOM manipulation, and learning the basics of interactivity.  
🔹 **Mini Projects:** Simple apps that helped me practice my coding skills.  

## 🎯 Why I Uploaded This Repo  
💡 **To track my progress** – It’s fun to see how much I’ve improved!  
💡 **To share my early work** – Maybe someone else can learn from these projects too.  
💡 **To revisit & improve** – Some of these ideas could be enhanced with what I know now.  

## 🚀 What’s Next?  
I’m now focusing on **modern frontend development** with **React, TypeScript, and the MERN stack**. But I’ll always remember where I started!  

If you’re just starting out, **keep going!** Every struggle you face now is a lesson that will make you a better developer.
